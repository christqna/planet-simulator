# Interstellar Orbit simulator
A planet simulator programmed in C by Ryan and Christina, implemented on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. Uses Keplers Laws of Planetary Motion to display a planet's orbit based on user-inputted mass, x/y velocity, and distance from the sun.

I/O: VGA double-buffering, PS2 Mouse


Customize your planet and see how it orbits!
